			In case of misfire event, the trigger is re-scheduled to the next scheduled time after 'now' with the repeat count left unchanged (missed events are definitively lost). 
			<br/>
			<strong>Warning:</strong> This policy could cause the trigger to go directly to the complete state if the end-time of the trigger has arrived,
			so this misfire instruction doesn't guarantee that the repeat counter reaches your max value, but it guarantees that the end-time doesn't go over the expected final fire time.
